#subroutine: A Subroutine is like a mini program

#These mini program does not depend upon other other codes in a program

#Rather than repeating a block of code repeatedly we can define a subroutine once and 
#and call it multiple times

#These subroutines can be built-in python or can be userdefined

#python has two types of subroutine they are :
                          #Function 
                          #Methods

#Functions:

#some of the functions we have used are print(),float(),input() are some of the inbuilt 
#functions of python

#Methods:

#Methods are the second type in subroutines 
#Example of methods are:
#.append(),.upper(),.get()

'''methods are designed to work with something specific and this specific thing comes 
before a the dot (.) and these are called object
'''
 #for example:

'''
 mylist=[1,2,3]
 mylist.append("10")
 here the mylist is the object '''

 #most of the datastructure has object
